# Food Expiration App
The Food Expiration App is a collaborative mobile application developed by SUPSI and Penn State University. This app assists users in managing their refrigerator's contents, reducing food waste by tracking expiration dates, and locating nearby food banks.

## Features
### Food Inventory Management System

Allows users to keep track of the food items in their fridge with ease. With this feature, users can efficiently manage their food inventory, reduce waste, and save money.

### Expiration Date Tracker

This is a critical feature of the Food Inventory Management System. This feature helps users to stay on top of the expiration dates of their groceries, enabling them to use food before it goes bad and avoid unnecessary waste.

### Notification System

This is an essential component of the Food Inventory Management System. This feature sends timely notifications to the users when their food items are about to expire, ensuring that they can consume them before they go bad.

### Recipe Generator

This feature empowers users to create delicious meals using the food items they have in their fridge. This feature leverages an extensive database of recipes, enabling users to generate personalized recipe suggestions based on the food items they have on hand.

### Food Bank Locator
This feature enables users to locate the nearest food banks in their area easily. This feature leverages a robust mapping system, allowing users to visualize the location of food banks in their vicinity. The Food Bank Locator feature also provides critical information such as contact details, and the address of each location.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies are used to develop the Food Expiration App:

- `React Native` - a popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications
- `Expo` - a set of tools and services that make it easy to build, deploy, and share React Native applications
- `NativeBase` - a UI component library for React Native that provides a set of customizable components for building mobile applications
- `npm` - a package manager for JavaScript used to manage the app's dependencies
## Getting Started
