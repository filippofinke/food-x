# Food Expiration App

This app is designed to help you manage the food in your fridge and reduce food waste by keeping track of expiration dates and connecting you with local food banks.

## Features

The app has three main features:

**Create a List** : You can easily create a list of the food in your fridge by manually adding items or scanning the barcode of a product to add it to your list. This list will help you keep track of when your food expires and prevent you from accidentally letting food go bad.

**Scan Barcode** : The app allows you to scan the barcode of a product to quickly add it to your list. You can add a product manually if the app is unable to determine what you are scanning.

**Find Food Banks** : The app also helps you find local food banks where you can donate your excess food or find resources if you need food assistance. This feature connects you with your community and helps reduce food waste on a larger scale.

## Technologies Used

The app was built using React Native and Native Base for the frontend:
